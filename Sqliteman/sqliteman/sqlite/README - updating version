As of the time of writing, this directory contains version 3.9.2 of the sqlite3
distribution. If you upgrade to a later version, some changes need to be made.

sqliteman uses two procedures for shell.c, run_table_dump_query and
run_schema_dump_query. This means that shell.c has to be built into the
sqliteman executable, and some small changes have to be made to the shell.c file
as distributed to make this work. These are as follows:-

1) You can only have one "main" procedure, which is the one in sqliteman,
   so the main in shell.c needs to be declared static.
2) Since run_table_dump_query and run_schema_dump_query are called from outside
   shell.c, the static keywords on their declarations have to be removed.

Since run_table_dump_query and run_schema_dump_query are not published
sqlite3 interfaces, the sqlite developers are free to change them between
releases, and sometimes do so. You need to check that all the declarations in
shell.c (including the types) match those in shell.h (shell.h is an sqliteman
file, not part of the sqlite3 distribution). If they don't match, shell.h will
need to be updated, and probably the call sites in database.cpp will need to be
modified as well.

A better long term solution would be to implement the fuctions of
run_table_dump_query and run_schema_dump_query in the main sqliteman code and
not depend on shell.c at all.
